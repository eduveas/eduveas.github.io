	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h3>Research</h3>
			<p> Computing has become an integral part of human existence, revolutionizing the way people perceive, interact with, and interpret the world. Yet, people routinely deal with larger, more complex volumes of information, while intelligent technology undertakes human activities. With artificially intelligence having more agency over aspects of the system and the information, a challenge arises in communication and collaboration between human and AI.
			</p>
			<p class="diagram">
			  <img  src="media/hai-diagram.jpeg"></img>

			</p>
			<p id="goal">
			  The overarching goal of this agenda is to investigate methods that promote a mutual understanding between humans and AI, enabling humans and AI to engage in synergistic collaboration. The aim is to enhance human capabilities, to empower them to achieve tasks previously considered impossible, while maintaining a seamless and natural interaction. Fundamental elements needed to succeed are:
			</p>
			<p>
<span>AI-Human Synergy.</span> Systems that not only serve as tools but also actively collaborate with individuals perceiving and interpreting their context, preferences, and evolving needs. <br/>

			  <span>Wearable human augmentation.</span> 
			  Wearable and immersive techniques play a crucial role in the interaction with AI in context for example of a digital twin.<br/>
			  <span>Explainable AI and Trustworthy Interaction.</span> For seamless human-AI collaboration, AI systems that are not only powerful but also transparent and interpretable, enhance user understanding. Users wonder whether they can trust the AI and also whether they can trust the explanations.

		  <h3>HCC: Human Centered Computing Labs</h3>
		  <p>
		    The <a href="/labs/hcc.html" class="lablink">Human Centered Computing Labs</a> is a new facility at Graz University of Technology intended to support interdisciplinary research on technology for humans. It was planned by Eduardo with input from the faculty of Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering at TU Graz. The HCC consists in six laboratories: i) wearable technology and interface fabrication lab, ii) immersive computing lab, iii) vehicle human interaction lab, iv) classroom lab, v) usability lab, vi) game experience lab. The scientific work in this research agenda is mainly supported by labs (i) -- (iii). And, Eduardo's team offers support to the faculty in maintaining and using the infrastructure.

			<h3>Teaching</h3>
			<p> I have put together a curriculum for modern human computer interaction topics complementing the offer in visual computing at TUG. It consits of four courses offering students to learn concepts in contemporary computer science and human computer interaction while building and evaluating prototypes. The final phase will be in place with the class on Wearable Computing in SS2021. 
			</p>

			<p class="class"> <a class="classname" href="">Human Factors Lab:</a> 
			  The goal of this seminar is for students of the <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/en/studying-and-teaching/degree-and-certificate-programmes/masters-degree-programmes/computational-social-systems">Masters in Human Factors (CSS)</a> to acquire the concepts and the methods to analyze human aspects of a system, propose and design the methods to elicit and observe human factors, and deliver recommendations for future designs based on such studies. Topics include: Human Factors and Ergonomics, Human Factors Engineering, Perceptual issues and evaluations, Information processing, Sensation and perception, basic anatomy and physiology, antropometry, decision making and decision support.
			</p>


			<p class="class"> <a class="classname" href="http://kti.tugraz.at/staff/eveas/courses/ui/index.html">User Interfaces:</a>This course focuses strongly  on prototyping hardware and software for user interfaces. Target audience: bachelor 2 -4 semester. It covers ideally, a balanced mix of a) concepts of human perception and introduction to actuators for visual, olfactory, tactile, auditory and motor inter- faces, ii) hardware design with sensors/actuators and electronics, b) implementation of a Human Interface Device driver, 3) simple demo application.</p>
			<p class="class"> <a class="classname" href="http://kti.tugraz.at/staff/eveas/courses/evalme/index.html">Evaluation Methodology:</a> The aim is for students to acquire the methodology to formulate hypotheses and design their validation procedure. The lecture is divided into three major blocks, statistical methods, evalua- tions from a scientific point of view, and exemplary evaluations in diverse sub-fields: interactive applications, visualization, haptics, eye tracking, crowdsourced studies, recommender systems.</p>
			<p class="class"> <a class="classname" href="http://kti.tugraz.at/staff/eveas/courses/iui/index.html">Intelligent User Interfaces:</a> This course is about interfaces that collect data from the user and create models to anticipate or adapt the interaction accordingly. Students build an interface including data collection, ma- chine intelligence and interaction widgets. The course provides basic building blocks to select and train deep neural network models as proxies of the machine intelligence. Topics include: data collection and processing, deep learning and PyTorch basics, LSTM basics, time-series clas- sification, CNN basics, image processing, gesture recognition, optimization and reinforcement learning, recommender systems, active learning, explainable AI. </p>
			<p class="class"> <a class="classname" href="http://kti.tugraz.at/staff/eveas/courses/wc/index.html">Wearable Computing: </a> This course is intended to provide knowledge in wearable interface prototyping, wearable hu- man machine interaction and the computing methodologies used with wearables. The course dives into the architecture and techniques used to build: monocular displays, binocular displays, wearable haptics devices, smart gloves, wearable physiological sensors, exo-skeletons.</p>

			<!--p> The teaching concept originates with my research on learning strategies. Students are gradually introduced theory with research examples while they work on a project. Through the project based lectures, students learn to articulate  theory into their work, to reflect, and to objectively critique various works. 			</p-->
